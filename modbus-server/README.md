# Modbus Server

Pretty simple modbus server that can be used for testing purposes.

## Usage

The only things to do is to copy the `modbus_server.py` file to the VM and run it with python3.

⚠️ Modify the IP adress in the file to match the IP address of the VM. ⚠️
```bash
sudo python3 modbus_server.py
```
